# Python Basics Practice

This repository contains a Python script that covers essential foundational concepts in Python programming. It is designed as a beginner-friendly practice file that introduces key topics through simple examples and a few challenges.

## Topics Covered

1. **Variables & Data Types**  
   - Declaration and initialization of variables  
   - Understanding types like int, float, string, and boolean  

2. **Conditional Statements**  
   - if, elif, else statements  
   - Using logical conditions to control program flow  

3. **Loops & Pattern Printing**  
   - Using `for` and `while` loops  
   - Basic pattern printing with nested loops  

4. **Lists & Comprehensions**  
   - Creating and modifying lists  
   - List slicing and iteration  
   - Using list comprehensions for compact loop-based operations  

5. **Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries**  
   - Working with immutable tuples  
   - Set operations and uniqueness  
   - Dictionaries for key-value storage and retrieval  

6. **Challenge: Word Frequency Counter**  
   - Using dictionaries to count the frequency of words in a given text  
   - String preprocessing (lowercasing, removing punctuation)  

7. **List Mutability in Functions**  
   - Demonstrating how lists are mutable by modifying a list inside a function  
   - Understanding side effects of passing mutable objects to functions
